# Lanthanide-0.3

This is the ancient Python software which I used during my PhD work and some time after finishing my PhD [1]. The 
software provides the calculation all matrix elements of angular spherical tensor operators for the electron 
configurations of lanthanide ions. Included is also code to fit radial integrals to measured energy level spectra, as 
well as the code for Judd-Ofelt fits and the calculation of all radiative electric and magnetic dipole transitions 
inside the energy level spectrum of lanthanide ions.

**Note:** This software is outdated and intended for reference only. If you really want to run it, you can use a 
virtual machine running SuSE Linux 9.3. This is how I restarted it in 2025 to compare it with the results of its 
successor [Lanthanide](https://github.com/reincas/Lanthanide) package. You find a copy of my thesis [1] within the Lanthanide package To avoid the 
repeated calculation of all required matrices, you should  place a symbolic link to the folder 'matrix' in each of 
your working directories.
