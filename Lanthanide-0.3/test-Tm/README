For compiling and using Lanthanide some libraries are needed:

- liblapack.a
- libblas.a
- libF77.a

They may be taken from the clapack package and must be reachable by
the compiler (e.g. in $HOME/lib).

Furthermore Python together with two packages is needed. I use the
following versions:

- Python 1.5.2
- Distutils 1.0.1
- Numerical 14 

From the Python package Numerical the header file arrayobject.h must
be reachable by the compiler (e.g. in $HOME/include).

To use the Python package Lanthanide, it must be compiled and
installed first. The command 'make install' installs the package to
$HOME/lib/python/Lanthanide. This path must be given in the
environment variable PYTHONPATH, so that Python finds the files:

  export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/python/Lanthanide
