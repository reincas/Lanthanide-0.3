Acknowledgements:
-----------------
	
The basic ideas of this package are taken from the program ADMZ from
Sverker Edvardsson & Daniel Aberg, developed in July 1998 and
published in Comp. Phys. Commun. 133(2001)396, but Lanthanide does not
contain any code from ADMZ.



Preconditions:
--------------

This package was developed on a Linux system and should work at least
with the following program and package versions:

  Python 2.2              (http://www.python.org)
  Numeric 21.3            (http://www.numpy.org)

The matrix operations use the standard LAPACK library. To compile the
external Python modules (C libraries) of Lanthanide, you need two
libraries:

  liblapack.so.3          (http://www.netlib.org/lapack)
  libblas.so.3            (http://www.netlib.org/blas)

On my system liblapack and libblas were compiled with g77, therfore I
also need the following library:

  libg2c.so.0

If you use liblapack and libblas not compiled with g77, you will have
to modify setup.py accordingly.

However, Lanthanide may also work with older or more recent versions
of the above packages and libraries



Some installation instructions:
-------------------------------

Install this package by

>  python setup.py install

This will copy all necessary files to the directory

  $HOME/lib/python/Lanthanide

To use these files add this directory to the environment
variable PYTHONPATH.



Test the installation:
----------------------

Run

>  cd test
>  python test.py

This runs an energy level fit in three stages with an increasing
number of fit parameters. The results are stored in the directory
./energy/Pr. In this directory the files *.parm contain the values of
the fit parameters and the files *.fit contain six ASCII tables:

  - start and end values of fit parameters
  - comparison of measured and calculated energy levels
  - matrix linking SLJ and intermediate coupling scheme
  - Judd-Ofelt parameters
  - comparison of measured and calculated oscillator strengths
  - some important quantities for the absorption transitions

If you also installed the package Spectrum, then run

>  python test-all.py

which gives the same results, but starts from scatch with the
absorption spectra and uses the results from the evaluation of these
spectra for the tables of measured energy levels and oscillator
strengths.
